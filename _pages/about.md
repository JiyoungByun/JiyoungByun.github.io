I'm a Ph.D. candidate in <a href="aiem.jhu.edu/">Artificial Intelligence for Engineering and Medicine Lab at 
<a href="https://www.bme.jhu.edu/">Department of Biomedical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University</a>.
My research interests broadly include <strong>machine learning</strong> and its applications to <strong>healthcare</strong>.

Currently, my work aims to bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI methodologies and their real-world deployment in medical environments, with an emphasis on improving diagnostic accuracy and addressing challenges such as data scarcity and domain shifts in clinical imaging datasets.

I received my B.S. and M.S. degree in Dept. of Bio and Brain Engineering from KAIST in 2018 and 2021, respectively, 
under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zsVfg6sAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Yong Jeong</a>.
