I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the <a href="https://aiem.jhu.edu/">Artificial Intelligence for Engineering and Medicine Lab</a> at <a href="https://www.bme.jhu.edu/">Department of Biomedical Engineering</a>, Johns Hopkins University. My research focuses on <strong>foundation models</strong> and their real-world applications in <strong>healthcare</strong>.

Under the guidance of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=L60tuywAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Rama Chellappa</a>, I work on tackling challenges such as <strong>multimodality</strong>, <strong>data scarcity</strong>, and <strong>domain shifts</strong> in clinical datasets as they relate to <strong>foundation models</strong> .

I received my M.S. and B.S. degree in Dept. of Bio and Brain Engineering from KAIST, under the supervision of Prof. Yong Jeong. My master’s research focused on graph neural networks and leveraging multimodal data—including MRI, demographics, and genomics—for Alzheimer’s Disease prediction.
