I'm a researcher in <a href="http://ibrain.kaist.ac.kr/">Lab. for Cognitive Neuroscience & NeuroImage</a> at 
<a href="https://bioeng.kaist.ac.kr/">Dept. of Bio and Brain Engineering, KAIST</a>.
My research interests broadly include <strong>machine learning</strong> and its applications to <strong>medical images</strong>.

I received my B.S. and M.S. degree in Dept. of Bio and Brain Engineering from KAIST in 2018 and 2021, respectively, 
under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zsVfg6sAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Yong Jeong</a>.
During my master's degree study, I conducted research on graph neural network to classify Alzheimer's Disease.
